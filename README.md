# Classification of Chemical Biodegradation

#### -- Programming Language: R
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro

Determining whether a specific chemical can be classified as biodegradable or not biodegradbale is an invaluable tool in the analysis of its overall effect on the environment.

## Project Objective

- Reproduce the methods and results of the publication "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Models for Ready Biodegradability of Chemicals", related to the KNN, PLSDA, and SVM models.

- Implement novel modeling techniques (e.g., Random Forests) in order to assess whether predictive performance can be increased, or a less complex model with similar performance can be obtained.

## Project Description

This project aims to validate the study "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Models for Ready Biodegradability of Chemicals" and improve on its performance, the team created various modeling methods which are as follows, Baseline Models, Validation Models, and Novel Models. Each of which contains various algorithms to validate the study’s performance metrics and create entirely new models to compare against the validation models.
